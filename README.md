# Bazel Build Examples

This collection of examples demonstrates how to use [bazel](https://bazel.build/) on iOS builds.

## HelloWorld

The [HelloWorld](ios/HelloWorld) iOS example is a Swift project that was
generated by Xcode 11.3.1 and remains
in the same structure as when it was generated. The project file was removed
and replaced with a bazel build.

The [ios/HelloWorld](ios/HelloWorld) folder contains a makefile named
[Makefile.bazel](ios/HelloWorld/Makefile.bazel) that shows
the bazel commands required to build. It also contains commands to install
and launch the build on a simulator.
